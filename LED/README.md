# Control LED from a web server

First, I try to control the LED just like I'd do with a classic microcontroller.
Then, I will try to control the LED from a web page on a local network.
Finally, I will do the same but with a network created by the esp8266, in AP mode

## First step

The LED is plugged on GPIO2 (D4) and to the ground.
For some reason, the onboard LED blink as well.
